  <h1 class="index-header text-center">The IITM-ECR Hub</h1>
  <p class="index-subtext text-center">“Built right, from the ground up.​”</p>

    <li>
      <p class="index-pointer-title">Background and Rationale</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Earth system science is advancing rapidly with the integration of
        high-resolution models, diverse observational datasets, AI, and
        interdisciplinary approaches. However, Early Career Researchers (ECRs)
        often face challenges navigating through the breadth and complexity of
        the field. ECRs come from various educational backgrounds or domains,
        each bringing valuable insights, but also facing a steep learning curve
        when crossing into climate-specific methodologies and frameworks.
        Recognizing the need for support and collaborative opportunities, we
        propose the establishment of an IITM-ECR Hub. IITM-ECR Hub can provide
        structured onboarding, cross-training, and exposure to key climate
        science concepts and tools. This hub will provide a platform to ECRs for
        regular discussions, handholding, and a platform for collaborative
        earth-system related activities such as modeling, prediction,
        variability, applications, and outreach.
        <br />
        This initiative will create a vibrant community of young scientists and promote
        shared learning, collaboration, and innovation. Diverse perspectives from
        the members of IITM-ECR Hub bring creative problem-solving and modern-day
        approaches, from AI-driven modelling to community-based development strategies
        at IITM. While global programs such as WCRP, WWRP, and WMO have dedicated
        platforms and leadership tracks for ECRs, a similar structured ecosystem
        is currently lacking at IITM. Hence, the establishment of an ECR hub at IITM
        will help build a strong, well-supported, and visible ECR community locally,
        while also establishing active linkages with international ECR networks.
        The ECR hub will be designed for future expansion across other MoES institutes,
        fostering a nationally integrated community of early-career scientists.

      <p class="index-pointer-title">Who is an ECR</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        An Early Career Researcher (ECR) is an individual who is in the early
        stages of their research career. This typically includes:​
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Graduate students (Master’s or PhD level)​</li>
        <li>Postdoctoral researchers</li>
        <li>
          Researchers who have completed their highest degree (usually a PhD)
          within the past 10 years and are actively engaged in research related
          to climate, atmospheric, oceanic, cryospheric, or broader Earth system
          sciences.
        </li>
        <li>
          The term is commonly used to recognize and support those who are
          building their academic and professional profiles, developing
          independent research agendas, and contributing to their respective
          fields through scholarly work.​

    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="index-pointer-title">Objectives</p>
      <br />
      <p>The ECR Club will aim for:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Professional Development: Empower ECRs with skills in science
          communication, build professional network, web presence, proposal
          writing, and portfolio building using open-source tools.
        </li>
        <li>
          Promote Data and Code Sharing and enhance transparency and
          reproducibility in climate research via GitHub and other open-source
          platforms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Support Interdisciplinary Collaboration and help resolve deadlocks in
          cross-domain studies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create Best Practices & Protocols for modeling workflows that are
          scalable and accessible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Build a Bridge to Next-Gen Researchers through online platforms and
          global collaboration.
        </li>
        <li>
          Facilitate Knowledge Exchange through regular meetings, seminars, and
          newsletters.
        </li>
